PyCitySchools

The PyCitySchools code is created to analyze Charter and District school performance and their budget. I used the following sources to help write the code: pandas.pydata.org, google, bing, and BCS by watching our cloud recordings on pandas and jupyter notebook and by doing and revisiting our class activities. The codes provided in the challenge also helped guide me in the right direction.
